		<font size=5><b>Dr. Paolo Gaudiano</b></font>
		<br>

		<font size=3><p>Building upon more than three decades of interdisciplinary research, teaching,
		entrepreneurship, consulting, public speaking and writing, in late 2015 he embarked on
		a mission to use everything he has learned to revolutionize the way people think about
		Diversity & Inclusion, and what they do about it.</p>
		
		<p>Since that time, he has taken a three-pronged approach that combines a software
		startup <a href="https://aleria.tech">(Aleria)</a> to help corporations understand how being more inclusive drives greater
		performance and employee satisfaction, a non-profit <a href="https://www.aleriaresearch.org">(ARC)</a> that leverages scientific
		research to drive greater inclusion and equality across many societal issues, and an
		academic research center <a href="https://www.qsdi.org/index.html">(QSDI)</a> that conducts core D&I research using unique,
		human-centric computer simulations.</p></font></div>
